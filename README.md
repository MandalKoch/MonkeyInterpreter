# Monkey Interpreter in C# - Learning by Doing
https://interpreterbook.com/
## Project Overview:

Welcome to the Monkey Interpreter, a C# implementation inspired by the fantastic book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. This project empowers you to delve into the fascinating world of interpreter development using a familiar and widely adopted language.

## Key Features:

    Interprets Monkey code: Execute your Monkey scripts seamlessly within this C# implementation.
    Faithful to the book: Adheres to Ball's guidance, ensuring consistency and alignment with the learning journey.
    Open-source and collaborative: Welcome contributions and discussions to enhance the interpreter and support fellow learners.

## Getting Started:

    Prerequisites:
        .NET SDK >= 8 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
        A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio).

    Clone the Repository:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/MandalKoch/MonkeyInterpreter.git

    Open in IDE:
    Open the monkey-interpreter-csharp.sln solution file in your preferred IDE.

    Build and Run:
        Select the desired build configuration (e.g., Debug or Release).
        Build the solution.
        Execute the MonkeyInterpreter executable located in the bin folder (e.g., bin/Debug/MonkeyInterpreter.exe).

## Usage:

    Interactive REPL: Launch the interpreter without arguments to enter an interactive Monkey REPL.
    Run Scripts: Provide a Monkey script file path as an argument (e.g., MonkeyInterpreter.exe your_script.mon).

## Credits and Learning Resources:

## Enjoy the Journey!

This C# implementation provides a stepping stone for you to explore interpreter development and grasp the core concepts covered in the book. Feel free to experiment, build upon this project, and share your findings. Remember, the learning journey is more important than the destination!

Additional Considerations:

    Error Handling: Enhance error handling and input validation for robustness.
    Testing: Integrate testing framework xUnit to ensure code quality.
    Documentation: Consider adding more detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples.
    Expand Functionality: If comfortable, delve into advanced features like garbage collection, closures, and advanced data structures.
